# Real Time Sign Language Detection (LSTM)

We will be using TensorFlow and Keras to create a realtime sign language predictor. This project is fully referencing to Nocholas Renotte's video. I only set the correct version of the mediapipe since the library has changed and adjusted the opencv codes to work.

The aim will be to will be predicting Singapore Sign Language (SGSL) since it fits the local context better. There is another project made by Debbie Ling Which I would like to credit. Below are her project info:

- https://github.com/dzldebby/sgsl

Unfortunately, I did not get this to work since my laptop could not handle the workload of the opencv and the model running at the same time, thus the project is put on indefinite hold.
